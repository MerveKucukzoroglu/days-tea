# Manual Testing
I have used django TestCase for manually testing views, forms and models files.
* Testing Views : Tested if the views are funcitoning as expected and returns pages that the user needs to be at.
* Testing Forms: Tested Poems Post form and Comment Form to make sure fields are as expected and the form is submitted to where it should.
* Testing Models: Models are tested while testing views and forms as well. But in addition, I tested if the models shows that featured image is a requirement and successfully sent to the database.

# Testing
